#Homework 8: Glider Flight
###Physics 2200: Dr. Rozman, Fall 2014
####Patrick Malloy   12/12/2014

This program calculates lengths of glider flights varying three 
separate conditions: initial velocity, initial angle, and initial
altitude. The program varies these values as follows:

- Velocity from .5 to 5
- Angle from -Pi/3 to Pi/3
- Altitude from .1 to 5

All calculation, compilations and graphs are controlled by the 
Makefile. Commands are as follows and should be self-explanatory.

- make altitude.png
- make angle.png
- make velocity.png
- make all
- make clean
- make veryclean
